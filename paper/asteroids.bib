	abstract = {We develop a fourth-order numerical integrator to simulate the coupled spin and orbital motions of two rigid bodies having arbitrary mass distributions under the influence of their mutual gravitational potential. We simulate the dynamics of components in well-characterized binary and triple near-Earth asteroid systems and use surface of section plots to map the possible spin configurations of the satellites. For asynchronous satellites, the analysis reveals large regions of phase space where the spin state of the satellite is chaotic. For synchronous satellites, we show that libration amplitudes can reach detectable values even for moderately elongated shapes. The presence of chaotic regions in the phase space has important consequences for the evolution of binary asteroids. It may substantially increase spin synchronization timescales, explain the observed fraction of asychronous binaries, delay BYORP-type evolution, and extend the lifetime of binaries. The variations in spin rate due to large librations also affect the analysis and interpretation of light curve and radar observations.}

abstract = {On February 15, 2013 asteroid (367943) Duende, provisionally named 2012 DA14, experienced an extremely close earth encounter, passing within 27,700 km altitude. An observation campaign was made possible by one year's notice of the flyby. This campaign, discussed in detail in the companion paper by Moskovitz et al. (2019), yielded visible-wavelength photometry before and after closest approach. Post-flyby Goldstone Doppler-delay radar data were also obtained. These data indicated a roughly 40 m × 20 m object in non-principal axis rotation. Leveraging light curve frequency analysis from the Moskovitz et al. companion paper, dynamical and inertia constraints from the rough radar-derived elongations, and simulated photometry, only two post-flyby states were deemed viable. These were a long axis mode (LAM) with long axis convention periods Pϕ¯=6.36 h and Pψ = 8.73 h and a short axis mode (SAM) with Pϕ¯=8.71 h and Pψ = 23.7 h (each with nominal long-intermediate and long-short ellipsoid axis ratios of 1.7:1 and 2.3:1 respectively). The SAM solution was more consistent with the post-flyby photometry and radar data. Nevertheless, there were differences between the amplitude and phase of the post-flyby and best-fit simulated SAM light curves at some epochs. These discrepancies may be due to a non-ellipsoidal shape, non-uniform albedo, and/or incorrect spin state solution (attitude, inertias, tumbling periods, or rotation mode). Analysis of the sparse pre-flyby photometry by Moskovitz et al. yielded poor Fourier series solutions for all principal axis states and different peaks in the pre and post-flyby WindowCLEAN power spectra. This suggests the asteroid was tumbling before the encounter and that its spin state changed. Propagating the best-fitting LAM and SAM solutions backwards through the flyby with terrestrial tidal torques resulted in significant dispersion of the rotation states. The pre-flyby SAM states coincided with the notable Moskovitz et al. Fourier solution P1 = 8.37 h and P2 = 24.2 h. Overall, we propose Duende was tumbling before the 2013 flyby and that its spin state may have changed during the flyby. Furthermore, our analysis suggests Duende is currently in SAM with Pϕ¯=8.71 h and Pψ = 23.7 h with pole J2000 ecliptic longitude and obliquity of roughly 70° and 95° or 245° and 90° respectively. The spin state characterization approach outlined in this paper could be used for future analyses with inertia, dynamical, and observational constraints.}

Several eclipse events of 0.2–0.3 mag were recorded. We refined the rotational period to 50.826 ± 0.002 h. The J2000 ecliptic coordinates of the pole of the system are: λ = 215 ± 2° and β = 65 ± 2°. The observed light curves have been reproduced synthetically by modeling each member of the system as an elongated ellipsoid, separated from each other by a distance equivalent to 5 times the sum of the two diameters. Assuming an identical internal composition of each component, we derived a bulk density of 3.8 ± 0.2 g/cm3. Such a high density is typical of M-type asteroids.}

abstract = {On 15 February 2013, the asteroid 367943 Duende (2012 DA14) experienced a near-Earth encounter at an altitude of 27,700 km or 4.2 Earth radii. We present here the results of an extensive, multi-observatory campaign designed to probe for spectral and/or rotational changes to Duende due to gravitational interactions with the Earth during the flyby. Our spectral data reveal no changes within systematic uncertainties. Post-flyby lightcurve photometry places strong constraints on the rotation state of Duende, showing that it is in non-principal axis rotation with fundamental periods of P1 = 8.71 ± 0.03 and P2 = 23.7 ± 0.2 h. Multiple lightcurve analysis techniques, coupled with theoretical considerations and delay-Doppler radar imaging, allow us to assign these periods to specific rotational axes of the body. In particular we suggest that Duende is now in a non-principal, short axis mode rotation state with a precessional period equal to P1 and oscillation about the symmetry axis at a rate equal to P2. Temporal and signal-to-noise limitations inherent to the pre-flyby photometric dataset make it difficult to definitively diagnose whether these periods represent a change imparted due to gravitational torques during the flyby. However, based on multiple analysis techniques and a number of plausibility arguments, we suggest that Duende experienced a rotational change during the planetary encounter with an increase in its precessional rotation period. Our preferred interpretation of the available data is that the precession rate increased from 8.4 h prior to the flyby to 8.7 h afterwards. A companion paper by Benson et al. (2019) provides a more detailed dynamical analysis of this event and compares the data to synthetic lightcurves computed from a simple shape model of Duende. The interpretation and results presented in these two works are consistent with one another. The ultimate outcome of this campaign suggests that the analytic tools we employed are sufficient to extract detailed information about solid-body rotation states given data of high enough quality and temporal sampling. As current and future discovery surveys find more near-Earth asteroids, the opportunities to monitor for physical changes during planetary encounters will increase.}

abstract={Formulae to compute the mutual potential, force, and torque between two rigid bodies are given. These formulae are expressed in Cartesian coordinates using inertia integrals. They are valid for rigid bodies with arbitrary shapes and mass distributions. By using recursive relations, these formulae can be easily implemented on computers. Comparisons with previous studies show their superiority in computation speed. Using the algorithm as a tool, the planar problem of two ellipsoids is studied. Generally, potential truncated at the second order is good enough for a qualitative description of the mutual dynamics. However, for ellipsoids with very large non-spherical terms, higher order terms of the potential should be considered, at the cost of a higher computational cost. Explicit formulae of the potential truncated to the fourth order are given.},

abstract = {We consider the solid–solid interactions in the two body problem. The relative equilibria have been previously studied analytically and general motions were numerically analyzed using some expansion of the gravitational potential up to the second order, but only when there are no direct interactions between the orientation of the bodies. Here we expand the potential up to the fourth order and we show that the secular problem obtained after averaging over fast angles, as for the precession model of Boué and Laskar [Boué, G., Laskar, J., 2006. Icarus 185, 312–330], is integrable, but not trivially. We describe the general features of the motions and we provide explicit analytical approximations for the solutions. We demonstrate that the general solution of the secular system can be decomposed as a uniform precession around the total angular momentum and a periodic symmetric orbit in the precessing frame. More generally, we show that for a general n-body system of rigid bodies in gravitational interaction, the regular quasiperiodic solutions can be decomposed into a uniform precession around the total angular momentum, and a quasiperiodic motion with one frequency less in the precessing frame.}

abstract = {We demonstrate that mutual gravitational interactions between an asteroid and a planet or another asteroid can play an important role in shaping an asteroid's spin state. We focus on two situations that asteroids may encounter during their lifetimes. The first is the environment after creation from a disrupted parent asteroid, when there may be many asteroid fragments interacting gravitationally with each other before their mutual escape. The other is the interaction between an asteroid and a planet during a hyperbolic flyby. In each case the mutual gravitational interaction can alter the asteroid's spin state. We derive analytical descriptions of the effects and perform numerical simulations to explore the interactions and to give examples. The net effect of many small interactions, taken in isolation, is to cause the asteroid to spin at a faster rate—although this must be balanced against all other effects that influence spin rates. Conversely, the effect of a single, strong interaction can fundamentally change an asteroid's spin state, causing it to tumble and significantly increasing or decreasing its overall angular momentum. We simulate interactions of a sphere of arbitrary mass with Toutatis and find that these types of gravitational interactions can provide partial explanations for the current Toutatis rotational state.}

abstract = {We present results of numerical simulations that show that Earth's tidal forces can both distort and disrupt Earth-crossing asteroids that have weak “rubble-pile” structures. Building on previous studies, we consider more realistic asteroid shapes and trajectories, test a variety of spin rates and axis orientations, and employ a dissipation algorithm to treat more accurately collisions between the particles that make up the model asteroid. We explore a large parameter space, including the asteroid's periapseq, encounter velocity with the Earthv∞, spin periodP, initial spin axis orientation, and body orientation at periapse. We parameterize the simulation outcomes by the amount of mass stripped from the asteroid during a flyby. Our most severe disruptions result in fragment trains similar in character to the “string of pearls” created when Comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 was disrupted near Jupiter in 1992. Less catastrophic disruptions cause material to be stripped off in more isotropic fashion, leaving a central remnant with a characteristic distorted shape. Some ejecta can enter into stable orbits around the remnant, creating a binary or multiple system. Even when no mass is lost tidal forces and torques can modify the asteroid's shape and spin. Our results show that mass loss is enhanced for small values ofq,v∞, andP, and depends to a certain extent on the body's initial spin orientation (for example, retrograde rotation reduces mass loss). An elongated asteroid was found to be far easier to disrupt than a spherical one, though the orientation of the ellipsoid at periapse can noticeably change the outcome. The size and orbital distribution of the ejecta are discussed, along with the applications of this technique towards an understanding of doublet craters, crater chains, and asteroids with peculiar shapes and spins.}

In this note, we present a tutorial review of the theory of the Moore--Penrose pseudoinverse. We present the first definitions and some motivations, and after obtaining some basic results, we center our discussion on the spectral theorem and present an algorithmically simple expression for the computation of the Moore--Penrose pseudoinverse of a given matrix. We do not claim originality of the results.
