# Asteroid tidal torque research project

## Description

This repo was created by Jack Dinsmore in June of 2021 to hold code, data, and progress reports for his research project on the effect of tidal torque on asteroids. The project was done with Professor Julien de Wit of MIT.

## File description
- **summaries/** contains progress reports and summaries of mathematical calculations.
- **math/** contains Mathematica files used to do some of the analysis.

## Project timeline
1. Create a robust and general model for asteroid shape and density profile
2. Write code to simulate an asteroid flyby for certain parameters
3. Extract a light curve for the asteroid flyby simulation
4. Use an MCMC to fit the predicted light curve to a simulated light curve from an asteroid with known shape and density profile. Compare the fitted model to the simulated asteroid.
5. Apply the fitting software to an actual flyby.

The intent is to start writing the paper for this project by the end of the summer of 2021, the summer between Jack's junior and senior years.
