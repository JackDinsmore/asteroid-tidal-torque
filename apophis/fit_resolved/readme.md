## April 24

Made this folder and modified it for a tumbling asteroid. Confirmed that the simulation built, but didn't test anything. Especially in danger are the initializing quaternions (both for the axis conversions from north to ecliptic to inertial) and the rotational periods.

## To do:

Make torque-free sample data, plot it, take fourier transforms, and confirm the correct periods

Check orbit shape

Figure out the parameterization of the system

If I remembered, I would also cite [Kaasalainen 2001](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/34/aah2821.pdf), state that my model is for SAMs, and mention that Apophis has MOI ratios extracted as well.
