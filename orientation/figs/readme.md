## Aug 5

Started the first run, which consists of ori e-2 sensitivity. I realized later that the likelihood model is slightly wrong because I did not cut off the arccos at +1.

## Aug 6

Started the second run, which consists of ori e-4 to e-8. I will later add -2 and -3 but they haven't yet finished and I just want to make sure the others work.

An IO error was encountered for 4 and 6 so I reran them. However, 5 looks great.
