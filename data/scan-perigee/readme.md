Staged today

Pulled up to 25 today and ran a fit to extract the way the uncertainty grows. Kind of interesting behavior ensues: one of the parameters is much more sensitive than the rest, and only a few vary with period.

I pulled the rest from the supercomputer today. I also started the density scan for high order parameters.
