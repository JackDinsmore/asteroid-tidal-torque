# Jan 21

Pulled part of fit (all except 00) today. There are a few things to check up on:

1. Why does redchi decrease for higher cadence? (It doesn't; there's just more scatter for high cadence because there's less data)
2. Demonstrate closeness of Klms fitted to true (Done)
3. Make the plot separate the tiers like the sigma plots (Done)
4. Pull last cadence (Done)

# Jan 26 (After wisdom teeth hiatus)

Solved above problems, including a klm true to fit comparison. I also put this in the paper. The only thing left to do is to figure out this critical time that sets the lump in cadence.
