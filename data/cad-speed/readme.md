Started, but haven't pushed yet. The idea will be to spawn a bunch of normal cadence text files, but adjust the speed by 0.5, 1, and 2 inside the fit python file manually.

Ready to push files. I will do 0.5 and 2 now.

Pulled 2, started 0.5 (there wasn't enough space on the sc to start it before). Results look good: like dependence does appear for this.
