Started, but haven't pushed yet. The idea will be to spawn a bunch of normal cadence text files, but adjust the speed by 0.5, 1, and 2 inside the fit python file manually.

## March 28

Ready to push files. I will do 0.5 and 2 now.

## March 29

Pulled 2, started 0.5 (there wasn't enough space on the sc to start it before). Results look good: like dependence does appear for this.

## March 30

I pulled the results, but realize that doubling the velocity doesn't do anything. You need to adjust the D(t) function, which I did. Rerunning cadence 0.5 and 2.
