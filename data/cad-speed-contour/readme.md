Wrote the scatter script. Plan is to a 10x20 grid from 0.5 to 2 on t_orbit/t_spin and 2-60 minute cadence.

Fixed a couple staging bugs

I realized that this would suffer from the same problems as period so I redid the scatter so that all encounters have the same gamma at perigee.

Pulled the samples today, except for 06-00. But it doesn't seem to matter. High tspin/torbit corresponds to high uncertainty in cadence.
