Created today. I pushed things to the supercomputer as well.

Completed today. I pulled things from the supercomputer after making a slight adjustment to display to make sure it could handle gaps. Everything worked fine, but I got some slightly unexpected results. So I changed the gap range from (0, 1) hr to (0, 2) hr and I upped the amount of data that was accepted (before, it was too low). Now it should yield some more interesting data.

Completed today. Pulled everything but gap 14. Things still don't look quite right, so I extended to 3 hours and tried again.

Reran the program because of a mistake I made (forgot to change the mask size)
