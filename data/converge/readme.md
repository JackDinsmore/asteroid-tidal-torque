# Converge data files

My goal is to get the fit to converge.

## August 4

I want to try setting a large cloud, so I have run 0. Then I implement Julien's advice of setting three parameters to the true values and varying one (runs 1.0-1.3)

## August 5

The fits look good! They're much closer to converging, but I need to run them again. I'm adding run 2 fits which have smaller spread.

## August 9

I just realized that I still have degeneracy in my model. So I'm removing it and rerunning some fits. The run 2 fits convinced me that big spread is better, or at least faster I think. So run 0 tests two fits for all parameters, with two different spread values. Run 1 tests fits only to one parameter, with the lower spread value.
