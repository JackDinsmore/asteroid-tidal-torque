# Converge data files

My goal is to get the fit to converge.

## August 4

I want to try setting a large cloud, so I have run 0. Then I implement Julien's advice of setting three parameters to the true values and varying one (runs 1.0-1.3)

## August 5

The fits look good! They're much closer to converging, but I need to run them again.
