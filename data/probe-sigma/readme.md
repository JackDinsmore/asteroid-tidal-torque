I'm starting a sigma scan at the two characteristic values I've determined, spread evenly over log space.

However, the scan is only as informative as my sigma model, because the definition of the sigma input depends strongly on the model. So I will need to do much more literature searching to find a very good sigma model I can justify, or try multiple models.
