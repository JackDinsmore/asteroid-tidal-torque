I'm starting a sigma scan at the two characteristic values I've determined, spread evenly over log space.

However, the scan is only as informative as my sigma model, because the definition of the sigma input depends strongly on the model. So I will need to do much more literature searching to find a very good sigma model I can justify, or try multiple models.

Today, I worked on the Hamiltonian formalism. But it didn't work because it's too complicated. Instead, I wrote up what I've done so far, revised the error model, and began official tests.

I finished extracting the data today. There are some holes, but it's generally pretty good! The initial angle one is not well fixed and that does not depend on sigma. But the other ones depend strongly on sigma.
