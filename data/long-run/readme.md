# Long-run data files

My goal is to get the fit to converge by using a very long run time

## August 27

My fits have run for a week. The problem is that the model has two solutions. I'm going to try to find this in the math. I wonder if the degeneracy is caused by high order Jlm. I'm going to run the fit with l=0.

After implementing only looking at converged walkers, all the fits converged. So I'm moving on to max K_l=3
