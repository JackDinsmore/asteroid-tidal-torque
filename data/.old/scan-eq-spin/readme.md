By the way, the point is to see how uncertainty changes based on where the spin pole is located along the equator. It's both to duplicate scan-spin-pole and to better assess uncertainty there to higher precision.

`on` means that the asteroid starts with the principal axes and the inertial axes aligned. `off` means misaligned.

I tried to pull, but realized that I had forgotten to recompile the sim and it threw. Rerunning.

I pulled today. It was only working on the second h5 fits so I terminated the procedures. I made the plot.

Conclusions: Gamma zero does not affect the locations of the high-uncertainty regions, which are in fact at +- Y. Also, K30 and K20 actually are affected. Maybe it really is just tau propto z.
