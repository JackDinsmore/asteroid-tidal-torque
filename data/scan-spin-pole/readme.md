Created today. Wrote scatter code and untested compile code.

Pushed to supercomputer while gap 2.0 and peri are still running

Pulled data today with two processes still running (16, 21). Code works. Waiting for two processes to finish.

Pulled last two data points, made display prettier, and wrote text. However, I hit a snag when I realized that I could not explain the white spots at \pm y. So I made a covariance invariant formulation which still has white spots, although not as bright. I learned that you always have zero torque when the phi coordinate is equal to alpha. Maybe torque engages at the semi latus rectum point? Can't figure out why spin pointing along y would give low precision, when it gives torque along z. However, spin along x gives zero torque and is observable.
