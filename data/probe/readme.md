I'm starting the parameter scan code: using some default choices of starting points, I scan the parameter space to correlate sigma with initial start point. I also check whether all the points are only two-fold degenerate, and where the second degenerate point is.

Next is sigma varying and theta0 varying, run only for the fixed points identified in stager/minimize-dist.py. This is followed by b and v inf varying.
