## October 18

I'm starting the parameter scan code: using some default choices of starting points, I scan the parameter space to correlate sigma with initial start point. I also check whether all the points are only two-fold degenerate, and where the second degenerate point is.

Next is sigma varying and theta0 varying, run only for the fixed points identified in stager/minimize-dist.py. This is followed by b and v inf varying.

## October 19
The above run finished, so I submitted a new one increasing the resolution. On Julien's advice, I also ran some fits like October 18 for higher experimental precision to understand exactly when the higher order parameters converge. These are the small-sigma runs.

Next step is to scan sigma and l1 at specific shape parameters.
