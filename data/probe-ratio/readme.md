I started this folder to scan the ratio between sigma_rho and sigma_theta, not just the value of sigma_theta itself. It's basically duplicate code to probe-sigma.

It worked. However, I looked at the plots and decided this is not really what I want. I want to fix the sigma product and show the parameters as a function of ratio. So I'll do that with my probe-ratio-prod directory.
