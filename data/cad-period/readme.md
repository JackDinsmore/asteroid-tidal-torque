I pulled the data. Looks good. I edited the fit file so that it takes shorter (runs only one fit) and then added a point with period of five. Submitted that to SC, as well as a few fits with varying flyby velocity.

I'm definitely catching the strong dependence of some sensitivity on period. But whether this sets the location of the bulge remains to be seen. Need to think of some clever way to display the data.

No bulge is visible. I'm thinking that I'll run another one with larger period later, after the currently running tests are done.`

Pulled data today. Bulge appears in same place, but still a little chunky. I'm going to add a 20 hour period.

## March 31

I pulled the last data point today and have enough data to assess period. Tomorrow I will also have enough data to assess the speed at encounter, and that should be enough.
