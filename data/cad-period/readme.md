I pulled the data. Looks good. I edited the fit file so that it takes shorter (runs only one fit) and then added a point with period of five. Submitted that to SC, as well as a few fits with varying flyby velocity.

I'm definitely catching the strong dependence of some sensitivity on period. But whether this sets the location of the bulge remains to be seen. Need to think of some clever way to display the data.
