# Converge data files

My goal is to get the fit to converge.

## Sept 1

I ran my first fit by minimizing first and it converged! The only task now is to make the initial minimization better. In the converge branch, I learned that l=3 parameters are very hard to fit to. Later, I checked this and confirmed that you can fit l=3 parameters, but only with a real honking big asteroid (for an Earth flyby). Order of km.
